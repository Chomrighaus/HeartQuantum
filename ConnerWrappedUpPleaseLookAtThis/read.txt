Through the magic of trying and not sleeping, I have come up with the following. Please take a look!

Also Please Note The Following:

Create a folder, call it whatever you want, maybe heart quantum or something.
Download the code and dataset.
Go to visual studio, and click create new project
Choose the very last option "From Existing Python Code"
Choose the folder you created
After just clicking through the rest (nothing special)
right click on each and every file and choose open
Then save each file, and attempt to run (it won't)
Then close everything (choose save or yes to any thing it throws at you)
Then open visual studio back up and choose open a local folder
Then choose the folder and click open
then it should work

there is probably an easier way to do this. My apologies...
